            <p class="main-p2">I'm a mom with five kids and the usual eating way as everyone, but after much housework, it's hard to refuse chocolate cake, waffles, Millefeuille pie…, etc. Sometimes I can pass and ignore it, sometimes I still eat some of them, sometimes I take it as my meal…and you know…then you have a swimming ring later…</p>
            <p class="main-p3">So, I was not confident and lost my health, and I doubted that I could return to the same situation I wanted. Could I still eat those delicious desserts and low burden simultaneously? That is my life attitude, making yourself with a low burden!</p>
            <h3 class="h3-4">***To the person who can't enjoy sugar or sweet dessert, this is the station for you, too😊</h3>
