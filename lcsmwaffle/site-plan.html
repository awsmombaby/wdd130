        Surprise! Come here and eat! What? You call me here to eat this table? NONONOâ€¦see youâ€¦!
Wait! These are not made from flour and milk. It's soy milk! And it's a low-carbon dessert! You can take this and low burden on your body! 
Do you like sweets and don't want to quit all of them? Come! I'll show you a happy time with waffles and still healthy in your life! With someone who doesn't like beans, you can feel free to have a taste and just like a traditional recipe.

I'm a mom with five kids and the usual eating way as everyone, but after much housework, it's hard to refuse chocolate cake, waffles, Millefeuille pieâ€¦, etc. Sometimes I can pass and ignore it, sometimes I still eat some of them, sometimes I take it as my mealâ€¦and you knowâ€¦then you have a swimming ring laterâ€¦

So, I was not confident and lost my health, and I doubted that I could return to the same situation I wanted. Could I still eat those delicious desserts and low burden simultaneously? That is my life attitude, making yourself with a low burden!

To the person who can't enjoy sugar or sweet dessert, this is the station for you, tooðŸ˜Š

      <h3>Low-Carbon</h3>
      <p>
        Soy milk is made from soy (yellow beans) and can replace milk or water. The process is still the same. You may need more clarification on the ingredients, which is a little expensive. Think about what you will eat for your body and what the body needs. Isn't it a good reason for you to realize what it needs? This price is reasonable. And you can go up to the online grocery store to buy premix power for low carbon. Today we introduce a premix power and the waffle recipe.

Ingredients: Almond powder, Erythritol, Psyllium powder, Aluminum-Free Baking Powder, vanilla powder (can without the last one)
Recipe: premix power 60g, one egg, soy milk 20g (fresh cream 20g), water 20g (if you don't want water, you can plus soy milk to 40g)
Step: 
1.	First, we add soy milk, egg, and premix power together, and when they stir well, keep stirring 5-6 times, then let go.
2.	Second, warm up your pan with a small fire, and pour the first step into it.
3.	Fry until small bubbles form on the surface, then flip over.
4.	Fry it for 30 seconds, then leave the pan. Well done!
PS.
1. If you use a handheld eggbeater to mix the stuff, do not over-stir.
2. If you use a waffle maker, based on the power of each machine being different, please adjust the time yourself.
3. Even though it tastes good, remember to eat in moderationðŸ˜Š

***The ingredient can be straightforward with only Almond powder, and Aluminum-Free Baking Powder can replace flour and egg. Based on some places, there appears to be an egg shortage. It's an excellent way to keep satisfying your body and your tongue.

      <h3>Waffles</h3>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at some creative ways to enjoy waffles!
How will you prepare to eat the waffles? We can drip some jams, honey, and fruit. Instead of eating directly, we can eat like this:
1.	Ice cream cookies.
2.	Pie crust. 
3.	Crepe.
4.	Millefeuille
5.	Waffle sandwich
6.	Add jams into waffles batter.
7.	Make a salad with a small waffleâ€¦etc.

Hmmm! Yammy!
